This project is for understanding how to design, implement, and test a JAX-RS (RESTful) Web Service in Java.

The service exposes REST endpoints, integrates with custom Java classes, and can be tested using tools like SoapUI, Swagger Editor, and Postman.

Main Features

JAX-RS RESTful API:
Implements a REST web service with resource classes annotated using JAX-RS annotations.

Endpoint Publishing:
The web service is deployed and published, exposing endpoints that can be consumed by REST clients.

WADL & OpenAPI:
WADL generated from the running service.
WADL converted to an OpenAPI JSON specification using APIMATIC.
API can be explored and tested using Swagger.
